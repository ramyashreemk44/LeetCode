# LeetCode Tracker
A personal collection of my accepted LeetCode submissions, automatically synced to GitHub. Tracking my progress and building consistency in solving DSA problems.

## üéØ Purpose
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through regular practice.
- Maintain a personal log of solved challenges.
- Revisit and improve solutions as I learn better approaches.

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure
Each problem is saved in a folder named after its LeetCode number and title, containing the corresponding solution file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Language
Most solutions are written in **Java**. You may occasionally find a few in **Python** or **C++** for specific practice.

## üîÑ Updates
This repository is updated regularly as I continue solving problems across different topics and difficulty levels.
