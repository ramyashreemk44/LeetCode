# LeetCode Tracker
A personal collection of my accepted LeetCode submissions, automatically synced to GitHub. Tracking my progress and building consistency in solving DSA problems.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through regular practice.
- Maintain a personal log of solved challenges.
- Revisit and improve solutions as I learn better approaches.

## 🗂️ Structure
Each problem is saved in a folder named after its LeetCode number and title, containing the corresponding solution file.

## 🛠️ Language
Most solutions are written in **Java**. You may occasionally find a few in **Python** or **C++** for specific practice.

## 🔄 Updates
This repository is updated regularly as I continue solving problems across different topics and difficulty levels.
